                            "Lost tapes" are the ultimate mystery prize in the music world. There's a near-mystical
                            power to the prospect of uncovering unheard tracks or early demos by musical heroes, and
                            even a fascination in the format itself. Before digital recording became standard in the
                            1990s, artists would rely on relatively bulky (and expensive) analogue tape; the
                            irreplaceable "master tape" would be the definitive version, from which all copies were
                            derived.

                            Lost tapes might emerge in various guises across countless genres: as unofficial rough-cut
                            bootlegs or carefully curated collections from hours of forgotten recordings. They might
                            have been literally salvaged from the trash – as with the Louis Armstrong & His All Stars

                            Michael Brooks in 1980), or a clutch of (still unreleased) tapes by Factory label acts

                            Still, few lost tape hauls evince the vastness and intrigue of late English producer Joe
                            Meek's Tea Chest Tapes: 67 crates containing nearly 2000 reels of previously unheard tracks
                            by 1960s acts including David Bowie's first band The Konrads, Tom Jones, Ray Davies, Billy
                            Fury, Gene Vincent, Georgie Fame, youthful singer-songwriter Mark Feld (later to become glam
                            rock idol Marc Bolan), Rod Stewart, Jimmy Page, John Leyton, The Tornados (whose 1962 global
                            smash hit Telstar, written and produced by Meek, summoned the space age), and an early
                            incarnation of British rockers Status Quo, to name a few. Following Meek's 1967 suicide, the
                            Tea Chest Tapes were bought and carefully stored by young musician/businessman Cliff Cooper
                            (whose band The Millionaires had been produced by Meek); a few months ago, the tapes were
                            acquired by much-loved independent label Cherry Red Records.

                            "This cult netherworld of mythical Tea Chest Tapes had been talked about in hushed tones for
                            decades," says Cherry Red's Catalogue Director and former Record Collector magazine
                            journalist John Reed. "Cliff kept these things for half a century, and now our job is to go
                            through them methodically, and work out how we bring them blinking into the light."

                            Meek himself was an undeniably controversial and volatile figure, occasionally likened to US
                            producer and murderer Phil Spector (who Meek reportedly regarded as a foe). His life was
                            complex, unnerving and ultimately brutal; his serious mental health issues were worsened by
                            debt and the threat of persecution for being gay (homosexual acts were then still illegal in
                            the UK). He killed himself at his flat/studio on London's Holloway Road in <time
                                datetime="1967-02">February 1967</time>, after fatally shooting his landlady, Violet
                            Shenton.

                        <p>
                            It was a tragic ending – yet there's no denying Meek's wildly innovative experiments in
                            music. His productions are unmistakably distinctive: intensely bright, haunting, somehow
                            otherworldly pop, they're also influential across generations, making the Tea Chest Tapes a
                            significant find.

                            Bristol-based musician-producer and lifelong Meek music devotee Alan Wilson is overseeing
                            the mastering and digitisation of the tapes at his Western Star studio: "From a technical
                            point of view, if you were to put Joe Meek's studio alongside his big label contemporaries
                            like EMI or PYE, they all had palatial buildings and multi-track facilities. Joe didn't have
                            that, so he kind of invented his own way of doing things, using two different tape
                            recorders, bouncing sounds off one on to the other, and cobbling things together. He was the
                            shoestring budget end of the music industry, yet he would [create] million-selling records
                            from his living room."

                            When I catch up with Cooper, he's soft-spoken and amiable, as well as a hugely astute
                            businessman (whose enterprises include founding iconic amp company Orange in 1968). He
                            vividly recalls Meek's studio ingenuity: "He used to bang Coca-Cola bottles together, or
                            stamp on the ground to create recording effects. On The Millionaires' single Wishing Well,
                            he got our guitarist to play behind the bridge of the instrument, which is how we got a
                            'harp' sound. He had a Leslie rotary speaker (with a tweeter which would spin around at the
                            top) in his bedroom, with leads coming down to his studio." According to Barry Cleveland’s
                            book Joe Meek’s Bold Techniques, <a
                                href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17864-joe-meek-i-hear-a-new-world/">
                                Meek was the first UK producer</a> to deploy overdubbing, compression,
                            spring reverb, flange, and tape loops to studio recordings.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Cooper had initially aimed to buy some of Meek's recording equipment from his posthumous
                            estate. Instead, he was allowed to purchase the Tea Chest Tapes, with the solicitor's
                            proviso that they were for studying Meek's production, and that ownership could become a
                            "litigation nightmare" if the tapes were released due to contractual obligations.
                        </p>

                            There were so many famous recordings, and so many unreleased tracks by now known artists,
                            that I felt it important to keep the tapes in a collection, and not to break it up – Cliff
                            Cooper

                            "I soon realised that I was the custodian of this incredible collection, but that I could
                            not do anything with them, other than to play and learn Joe's genius techniques," says
                            Cooper. "The responsibility also fell on me to store them in dry and temperate conditions,
                            so that the tapes would not deteriorate. There were so many famous recordings, and so many
                            unreleased tracks by now known artists, that I felt it important to keep the tapes in a
                            collection, and not to break it up."

                            For decades, the tapes were preserved wherever Cooper was based. In the mid-1980s, an
                            attempted catalogue of contents was made by the former president of the Joe Meek
                            Appreciation Society. In 2008, Cooper placed the tapes in a rock memorabilia auction, but
                            then vacillated, fearing that they'd be bought by a company who would merely capitalise on
                            the most famous tracks, and bury the rest. "I increased the reserve price," he admits.
                            "There were lots of 'zeros' on the end. I was relieved when they didn't sell."

                            It does sound like the tapes have now found the ideal home. Cherry Red Records (which has
                            also previously issued Meek's 1959 sci-fi concept album I Hear a New World) are now handling
                            their restoration both with precision and as a labour of love. That's reflected in Wilson's
                            ardent fandom and tech expertise, even as he explains that he initially approached the
                            project with trepidation. "If someone had just put these tapes into a lock-up garage, they
                            would have been a pile of dust by now," he says. "But when I played the first sample, I was
                            absolutely overjoyed with the quality. When Cliff made the deal with Cherry Red, they sent
                            2500kg of tapes down on a lorry. We've now got them stored in a very secure,
                            temperature-controlled location, and I'm working through them at a rate of about 100 tapes a
                            month; I'm about 600 reels in." Wilson estimates that this process will take two years,
                            adding: "I think my whole life has been an apprenticeship leading up to this job. I've known
                            about the existence of these tapes for years, but never thought I'd touch them."

                            Do lost tapes have a heightened allure in a digital era where we take it for granted that
                            seemingly infinite music is instantly accessible – and "hidden tracks" are obviously
                            trickier to conceal? We can often develop insatiable appetites for sounds by our favourite
                            acts, whether it's unearthed gems, alternative takes, or even studio chat that would be
                            "bladed" off a conventional release. And even now, there are reminders that classic music
                            can be both timeless and ephemeral; <a

                            Back at Western Star, Wilson's meticulous detail has spanned analysing handwritten notes to
                            really distilling the essence of the Tea Chest Tapes themselves. "Joe Meek started out with
                            mono recorders, and at some point ended up with stereo," he explains. "Picture a piece of
                            tape, a quarter of an inch wide. When you record in mono, the track sits across the full
                            width of that tape (in the trade, we call it 'full-width mono'). If you then take that
                            full-width mono pre-recorded tape, and tape over it using a stereo machine, well, stereo
                            records in two tracks, a left and a right, within that quarter of an inch – but it leaves a
                            little gap down the middle, like a central reservation, so that the left and right don't
                            merge."
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Knowing that cash-strapped Meek would have re-used tapes, Wilson decided to isolate this
                            "little gap" on the tape – and sure enough, discovered further music concealed within. "I
                            could hear a different track – I was listening to what was beneath the Tea Chest Tapes," he
                            says, happily. "It could well result in another thousand tracks that no one knew was on
                            there."
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It will be some time before we fully discover what the Tea Chest Tapes contain (updates can
                            be heard <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGc7A7EuvDEo9WnbRlvXKaCY-fCW6VOIY">

                            part of their tangible spell: "It's like a proper treasure hunt, where you have to search
                            everywhere, and you really don't know what's there…" Lost tapes are a part of history; the
                            promise of a new world; a glimpse of ghosts in the pop machine.
