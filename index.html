            An independent record label is releasing previously unheard tracks by David Bowie and Marc Bolan – all
            produced
            by
            Joe Meek, writes Arwa Haider.
            "Lost tapes" are the ultimate mystery prize in the music world. There's a near-mystical power to the
            prospect of
            uncovering unheard tracks or early demos by musical heroes, and even a fascination in the format itself.
            Before
            digital recording became standard in the 1990s, artists would rely on relatively bulky (and expensive)
            analogue
            tape; the irreplaceable "master tape" would be the definitive version, from which all copies were derived.

            More like this:
            - The mystery of a 'lost' rock genius
            - Pop stars' most extreme makeovers
            - America's first black superstars

            Lost tapes might emerge in various guises across countless genres: as unofficial rough-cut bootlegs or
            carefully
            curated collections from hours of forgotten recordings. They might have been literally salvaged from the
            trash –
            as
            with the Louis Armstrong & His All Stars master reels almost scrapped in a Columbia Records clear-out (but
            rescued
            by reissues producer Michael Brooks in 1980), or a clutch of (still unreleased) tapes by Factory label acts
            including Joy Division, saved from a skip outside Stockport's seminal (now defunct) Strawberry Studios.

            Still, few lost tape hauls evince the vastness and intrigue of late English producer Joe Meek's Tea Chest
            Tapes:
            67
            crates containing nearly 2000 reels of previously unheard tracks by 1960s acts including David Bowie's first
            band
            The Konrads, Tom Jones, Ray Davies, Billy Fury, Gene Vincent, Georgie Fame, youthful singer-songwriter Mark
            Feld
            (later to become glam rock idol Marc Bolan), Rod Stewart, Jimmy Page, John Leyton, The Tornados (whose 1962
            global
            smash hit Telstar, written and produced by Meek, summoned the space age), and an early incarnation of
            British
            rockers Status Quo, to name a few. Following Meek's 1967 suicide, the Tea Chest Tapes were bought and
            carefully
            stored by young musician/businessman Cliff Cooper (whose band The Millionaires had been produced by Meek); a
            few
            months ago, the tapes were acquired by much-loved independent label Cherry Red Records.

            "This cult netherworld of mythical Tea Chest Tapes had been talked about in hushed tones for decades," says
            Cherry
            Red's Catalogue Director and former Record Collector magazine journalist John Reed. "Cliff kept these things
            for
            half a century, and now our job is to go through them methodically, and work out how we bring them blinking
            into
            the
            light."

            Meek himself was an undeniably controversial and volatile figure, occasionally likened to US producer and
            murderer
            Phil Spector (who Meek reportedly regarded as a foe). His life was complex, unnerving and ultimately brutal;
            his
            serious mental health issues were worsened by debt and the threat of persecution for being gay (homosexual
            acts
            were
            then still illegal in the UK). He killed himself at his flat/studio on London's Holloway Road in February
            1967,
            after fatally shooting his landlady, Violet Shenton.

            It was a tragic ending – yet there's no denying Meek's wildly innovative experiments in music. His
            productions
            are
            unmistakably distinctive: intensely bright, haunting, somehow otherworldly pop, they're also influential
            across
            generations, making the Tea Chest Tapes a significant find.

            Bristol-based musician-producer and lifelong Meek music devotee Alan Wilson is overseeing the mastering and
            digitisation of the tapes at his Western Star studio: "From a technical point of view, if you were to put
            Joe
            Meek's
            studio alongside his big label contemporaries like EMI or PYE, they all had palatial buildings and
            multi-track
            facilities. Joe didn't have that, so he kind of invented his own way of doing things, using two different
            tape
            recorders, bouncing sounds off one on to the other, and cobbling things together. He was the shoestring
            budget
            end
            of the music industry, yet he would [create] million-selling records from his living room."

            When I catch up with Cooper, he's soft-spoken and amiable, as well as a hugely astute businessman (whose
            enterprises
            include founding iconic amp company Orange in 1968). He vividly recalls Meek's studio ingenuity: "He used to
            bang
            Coca-Cola bottles together, or stamp on the ground to create recording effects. On The Millionaires' single
            Wishing
            Well, he got our guitarist to play behind the bridge of the instrument, which is how we got a 'harp' sound.
            He
            had a
            Leslie rotary speaker (with a tweeter which would spin around at the top) in his bedroom, with leads coming
            down
            to
            his studio." According to Barry Cleveland’s book Joe Meek’s Bold Techniques, Meek was the first UK producer
            to
            deploy overdubbing, compression, spring reverb, flange, and tape loops to studio recordings.

            Cooper had initially aimed to buy some of Meek's recording equipment from his posthumous estate. Instead, he
            was
            allowed to purchase the Tea Chest Tapes, with the solicitor's proviso that they were for studying Meek's
            production,
            and that ownership could become a "litigation nightmare" if the tapes were released due to contractual
            obligations.

            There were so many famous recordings, and so many unreleased tracks by now known artists, that I felt it
            important
            to keep the tapes in a collection, and not to break it up – Cliff Cooper
            "I soon realised that I was the custodian of this incredible collection, but that I could not do anything
            with
            them,
            other than to play and learn Joe's genius techniques," says Cooper. "The responsibility also fell on me to
            store
            them in dry and temperate conditions, so that the tapes would not deteriorate. There were so many famous
            recordings,
            and so many unreleased tracks by now known artists, that I felt it important to keep the tapes in a
            collection,
            and
            not to break it up."

            For decades, the tapes were preserved wherever Cooper was based. In the mid-1980s, an attempted catalogue of
            contents was made by the former president of the Joe Meek Appreciation Society. In 2008, Cooper placed the
            tapes
            in
            a rock memorabilia auction, but then vacillated, fearing that they'd be bought by a company who would merely
            capitalise on the most famous tracks, and bury the rest. "I increased the reserve price," he admits. "There
            were
            lots of 'zeros' on the end. I was relieved when they didn't sell."

            <h2>Handled with care</h2>

            It does sound like the tapes have now found the ideal home. Cherry Red Records (which has also previously
            issued
            Meek's 1959 sci-fi concept album I Hear a New World) are now handling their restoration both with precision
            and
            as a
            labour of love. That's reflected in Wilson's ardent fandom and tech expertise, even as he explains that he
            initially
            approached the project with trepidation. "If someone had just put these tapes into a lock-up garage, they
            would
            have
            been a pile of dust by now," he says. "But when I played the first sample, I was absolutely overjoyed with
            the
            quality. When Cliff made the deal with Cherry Red, they sent 2500kg of tapes down on a lorry. We've now got
            them
            stored in a very secure, temperature-controlled location, and I'm working through them at a rate of about
            100
            tapes
            a month; I'm about 600 reels in." Wilson estimates that this process will take two years, adding: "I think
            my
            whole
            life has been an apprenticeship leading up to this job. I've known about the existence of these tapes for
            years,
            but
            never thought I'd touch them."

            Do lost tapes have a heightened allure in a digital era where we take it for granted that seemingly infinite
            music
            is instantly accessible?
            Do lost tapes have a heightened allure in a digital era where we take it for granted that seemingly infinite
            music
            is instantly accessible – and "hidden tracks" are obviously trickier to conceal? We can often develop
            insatiable
            appetites for sounds by our favourite acts, whether it's unearthed gems, alternative takes, or even studio
            chat
            that
            would be "bladed" off a conventional release. And even now, there are reminders that classic music can be
            both
            timeless and ephemeral; a 2008 fire in a Hollywood warehouse owned by Universal Music Group destroyed master
            tapes
            from the likes of Ella Fitzgerald, Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Buddy Holly, Loretta Lynn, Quincy Jones,
            Janet
            Jackson, Eminem and many more, and was reported in The New York Times as "The Day the Music Burned".

            Back at Western Star, Wilson's meticulous detail has spanned analysing handwritten notes to really
            distilling
            the
            essence of the Tea Chest Tapes themselves. "Joe Meek started out with mono recorders, and at some point
            ended up
            with stereo," he explains. "Picture a piece of tape, a quarter of an inch wide. When you record in mono, the
            track
            sits across the full width of that tape (in the trade, we call it 'full-width mono'). If you then take that
            full-width mono pre-recorded tape, and tape over it using a stereo machine, well, stereo records in two
            tracks,
            a
            left and a right, within that quarter of an inch – but it leaves a little gap down the middle, like a
            central
            reservation, so that the left and right don't merge."

            Knowing that cash-strapped Meek would have re-used tapes, Wilson decided to isolate this "little gap" on the
            tape –
            and sure enough, discovered further music concealed within. "I could hear a different track – I was
            listening to
            what was beneath the Tea Chest Tapes," he says, happily. "It could well result in another thousand tracks
            that
            no
            one knew was on there."

            It will be some time before we fully discover what the Tea Chest Tapes contain (updates can be heard via
            Cherry
            Red's online shows), but that, as Reed points out, is part of their tangible spell: "It's like a proper
            treasure
            hunt, where you have to search everywhere, and you really don't know what's there…" Lost tapes are a part of
            history; the promise of a new world; a glimpse of ghosts in the pop machine.
