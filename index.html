        An independent record label is releasing previously unheard tracks by David Bowie and Marc Bolan – all produced
        by
        Joe Meek, writes Arwa Haider.
        "Lost tapes" are the ultimate mystery prize in the music world. There's a near-mystical power to the prospect of
        uncovering unheard tracks or early demos by musical heroes, and even a fascination in the format itself. Before
        digital recording became standard in the 1990s, artists would rely on relatively bulky (and expensive) analogue
        tape; the irreplaceable "master tape" would be the definitive version, from which all copies were derived.

        More like this:
        - The mystery of a 'lost' rock genius
        - Pop stars' most extreme makeovers
        - America's first black superstars

        Lost tapes might emerge in various guises across countless genres: as unofficial rough-cut bootlegs or carefully
        curated collections from hours of forgotten recordings. They might have been literally salvaged from the trash –
        as
        with the Louis Armstrong & His All Stars master reels almost scrapped in a Columbia Records clear-out (but
        rescued
        by reissues producer Michael Brooks in 1980), or a clutch of (still unreleased) tapes by Factory label acts
        including Joy Division, saved from a skip outside Stockport's seminal (now defunct) Strawberry Studios.

        Still, few lost tape hauls evince the vastness and intrigue of late English producer Joe Meek's Tea Chest Tapes:
        67
        crates containing nearly 2000 reels of previously unheard tracks by 1960s acts including David Bowie's first
        band
        The Konrads, Tom Jones, Ray Davies, Billy Fury, Gene Vincent, Georgie Fame, youthful singer-songwriter Mark Feld
        (later to become glam rock idol Marc Bolan), Rod Stewart, Jimmy Page, John Leyton, The Tornados (whose 1962
        global
        smash hit Telstar, written and produced by Meek, summoned the space age), and an early incarnation of British
        rockers Status Quo, to name a few. Following Meek's 1967 suicide, the Tea Chest Tapes were bought and carefully
        stored by young musician/businessman Cliff Cooper (whose band The Millionaires had been produced by Meek); a few
        months ago, the tapes were acquired by much-loved independent label Cherry Red Records.

        "This cult netherworld of mythical Tea Chest Tapes had been talked about in hushed tones for decades," says
        Cherry
        Red's Catalogue Director and former Record Collector magazine journalist John Reed. "Cliff kept these things for
        half a century, and now our job is to go through them methodically, and work out how we bring them blinking into
        the
        light."

        Meek himself was an undeniably controversial and volatile figure, occasionally likened to US producer and
        murderer
        Phil Spector (who Meek reportedly regarded as a foe). His life was complex, unnerving and ultimately brutal; his
        serious mental health issues were worsened by debt and the threat of persecution for being gay (homosexual acts
        were
        then still illegal in the UK). He killed himself at his flat/studio on London's Holloway Road in February 1967,
        after fatally shooting his landlady, Violet Shenton.

        It was a tragic ending – yet there's no denying Meek's wildly innovative experiments in music. His productions
        are
        unmistakably distinctive: intensely bright, haunting, somehow otherworldly pop, they're also influential across
        generations, making the Tea Chest Tapes a significant find.

        Bristol-based musician-producer and lifelong Meek music devotee Alan Wilson is overseeing the mastering and
        digitisation of the tapes at his Western Star studio: "From a technical point of view, if you were to put Joe
        Meek's
        studio alongside his big label contemporaries like EMI or PYE, they all had palatial buildings and multi-track
        facilities. Joe didn't have that, so he kind of invented his own way of doing things, using two different tape
        recorders, bouncing sounds off one on to the other, and cobbling things together. He was the shoestring budget
        end
        of the music industry, yet he would [create] million-selling records from his living room."

        When I catch up with Cooper, he's soft-spoken and amiable, as well as a hugely astute businessman (whose
        enterprises
        include founding iconic amp company Orange in 1968). He vividly recalls Meek's studio ingenuity: "He used to
        bang
        Coca-Cola bottles together, or stamp on the ground to create recording effects. On The Millionaires' single
        Wishing
        Well, he got our guitarist to play behind the bridge of the instrument, which is how we got a 'harp' sound. He
        had a
        Leslie rotary speaker (with a tweeter which would spin around at the top) in his bedroom, with leads coming down
        to
        his studio." According to Barry Cleveland’s book Joe Meek’s Bold Techniques, Meek was the first UK producer to
        deploy overdubbing, compression, spring reverb, flange, and tape loops to studio recordings.

        Cooper had initially aimed to buy some of Meek's recording equipment from his posthumous estate. Instead, he was
        allowed to purchase the Tea Chest Tapes, with the solicitor's proviso that they were for studying Meek's
        production,
        and that ownership could become a "litigation nightmare" if the tapes were released due to contractual
        obligations.

        There were so many famous recordings, and so many unreleased tracks by now known artists, that I felt it
        important
        to keep the tapes in a collection, and not to break it up – Cliff Cooper
        "I soon realised that I was the custodian of this incredible collection, but that I could not do anything with
        them,
        other than to play and learn Joe's genius techniques," says Cooper. "The responsibility also fell on me to store
        them in dry and temperate conditions, so that the tapes would not deteriorate. There were so many famous
        recordings,
        and so many unreleased tracks by now known artists, that I felt it important to keep the tapes in a collection,
        and
        not to break it up."

        For decades, the tapes were preserved wherever Cooper was based. In the mid-1980s, an attempted catalogue of
        contents was made by the former president of the Joe Meek Appreciation Society. In 2008, Cooper placed the tapes
        in
        a rock memorabilia auction, but then vacillated, fearing that they'd be bought by a company who would merely
        capitalise on the most famous tracks, and bury the rest. "I increased the reserve price," he admits. "There were
        lots of 'zeros' on the end. I was relieved when they didn't sell."

        Handled with care

        It does sound like the tapes have now found the ideal home. Cherry Red Records (which has also previously issued
        Meek's 1959 sci-fi concept album I Hear a New World) are now handling their restoration both with precision and
        as a
        labour of love. That's reflected in Wilson's ardent fandom and tech expertise, even as he explains that he
        initially
        approached the project with trepidation. "If someone had just put these tapes into a lock-up garage, they would
        have
        been a pile of dust by now," he says. "But when I played the first sample, I was absolutely overjoyed with the
        quality. When Cliff made the deal with Cherry Red, they sent 2500kg of tapes down on a lorry. We've now got them
        stored in a very secure, temperature-controlled location, and I'm working through them at a rate of about 100
        tapes
        a month; I'm about 600 reels in." Wilson estimates that this process will take two years, adding: "I think my
        whole
        life has been an apprenticeship leading up to this job. I've known about the existence of these tapes for years,
        but
        never thought I'd touch them."

        Do lost tapes have a heightened allure in a digital era where we take it for granted that seemingly infinite
        music
        is instantly accessible?
        Do lost tapes have a heightened allure in a digital era where we take it for granted that seemingly infinite
        music
        is instantly accessible – and "hidden tracks" are obviously trickier to conceal? We can often develop insatiable
        appetites for sounds by our favourite acts, whether it's unearthed gems, alternative takes, or even studio chat
        that
        would be "bladed" off a conventional release. And even now, there are reminders that classic music can be both
        timeless and ephemeral; a 2008 fire in a Hollywood warehouse owned by Universal Music Group destroyed master
        tapes
        from the likes of Ella Fitzgerald, Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Buddy Holly, Loretta Lynn, Quincy Jones,
        Janet
        Jackson, Eminem and many more, and was reported in The New York Times as "The Day the Music Burned".

        Back at Western Star, Wilson's meticulous detail has spanned analysing handwritten notes to really distilling
        the
        essence of the Tea Chest Tapes themselves. "Joe Meek started out with mono recorders, and at some point ended up
        with stereo," he explains. "Picture a piece of tape, a quarter of an inch wide. When you record in mono, the
        track
        sits across the full width of that tape (in the trade, we call it 'full-width mono'). If you then take that
        full-width mono pre-recorded tape, and tape over it using a stereo machine, well, stereo records in two tracks,
        a
        left and a right, within that quarter of an inch – but it leaves a little gap down the middle, like a central
        reservation, so that the left and right don't merge."

        Knowing that cash-strapped Meek would have re-used tapes, Wilson decided to isolate this "little gap" on the
        tape –
        and sure enough, discovered further music concealed within. "I could hear a different track – I was listening to
        what was beneath the Tea Chest Tapes," he says, happily. "It could well result in another thousand tracks that
        no
        one knew was on there."

        It will be some time before we fully discover what the Tea Chest Tapes contain (updates can be heard via Cherry
        Red's online shows), but that, as Reed points out, is part of their tangible spell: "It's like a proper treasure
        hunt, where you have to search everywhere, and you really don't know what's there…" Lost tapes are a part of
        history; the promise of a new world; a glimpse of ghosts in the pop machine.
